# Rhythm
*Game development was done by Anthony Ling. Art Assets provided by Christopher Pan.*
## Description
Rhythm is a demo featuring a horizontal rhythm game with waves of enemies charging towards a line of knights. 
Each level is set up such that the enemies are attacking in waves based on the beat of the current song. 
The player's role is to press each corresponding key at specific times, mainly when the enemy is nearest to the attackbox.
## Origins
The project was assigned by the Game Design Decal in UC Berkeley in an event known as a "GameJam", in which groups of 2-3 join and attempt to create a game in a week.
This group consists of a coder (Anthony) and an artist (Christopher).
## Features
This demo features both a player, a recorder, and three built-in tracks.
- Player: Consists of "Knights" and "Monsters" and is the main way to play the demo
- Recorder: Is used to record a game. Has limited functionality unfortunately.
